# Logging with Logging Operator and Fluentd

* Install `gum` by following the instructions in https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#installation.

```bash
chmod +x logging/logging-operator.sh

./logging/logging-operator.sh
```

## Do

```sh
kubectl get loggings,fluentbitagents,outputs --all-namespaces

cat logging-operator/event-tailer.yaml

cp logging-operator/event-tailer.yaml infra/.

git add .

git commit -m "EventTailer"

git push

kubectl --namespace monitoring logs \
    --selector app.kubernetes.io/instance=default-event-tailer \
    | jq .
```

* If the output says `No resources found in monitoring namespace`, the `EventTailer` has not yet been deployed. Wait for a few moments and try again.

```sh
echo "http://grafana.$INGRESS_HOST"
```

* Open it in a browser
* Use `admin` as the user and `prom-operator` as the password
* Open `Explore`
* Choose `Loki` as the data source.
* Filter by `app_kubernetes_io_instance` set to `default-event-tailer`
